# Rhysida Decryptor

The Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) found a way to decrypt a Rhysida Ransomware.  
For everyone to download and for higher download speeds I'm sharing this Tool here.  

**Victims of the Rhysida ransomware may use the tool to try to decrypt their files for free, but we cannot guarantee the tool's safety or effectiveness.**


**※ Korea Internet & Security Agency provides ransomware recovery tools free of charge and does not take any legal responsibility for any problems that may occur during use.**  

Decryptor only works for encrypted files by the Rhysida Windows encryptor and cannot decrypt files encrypted on VMware ESXi.  

## How to use the decryptor:  

**※ Before using the recovery tool, be sure to back up encrypted files separately using a removable storage device.**

1. From .zip extract decryption Tool
2. Launch the decryption tool (.exe) as Administrator
3. After launching the Decryption Tool it will check for the:
* Infected files
* Encrypted files
4. When the Decryption Tool finishes - all possible decryptable files will be decrypted and 3 txt files will be created

TXT files will be created:
* Infected file list
* Decrypted file list
* Failed to decrypt file list  

Announcing the existence of a recovery tool in the media can spread awareness that a solution is available. However, it can also alert cybercriminals to correct their code.
